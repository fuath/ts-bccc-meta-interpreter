[g] Restructure project
  [ ] Bindings.ts becomes a whole directory of files
  [ ] `Python` semantics should be properly called `C#` semantics

[m] add `null`
[m] add C# to playground
[m] "il programma Ã¨ finito, ma il debugger resta bloccato sull'ultimo breakpoint"
[m] Getters vs function application (test example below):
  (string,string,(string,Func<int,Func<int,int>>)) v = ("Hello", "world", ("!",(x => y => x * y)));
  var h = v.Item3.Item2(3);
  var y = h(2);
[m] ++ operator
  [ ] i++
  [ ] ++i
[m] procedures (functions returning `void`)
[m] draw functions returning `void` as `Action`
[m] `Func<void,*>` should draw as `Func<*>`
[m] multidimensional array

[m] Use code font in debugger tables

[m] use something visual instead of debugger and typechecker_debugger
[m] errors with source range over code in editor
  [ ] Print properly (no `JSON.stringify`)
[m] comments
[m] highlighting with proper style
[m] properties
[m] add multiple highlightings (along the stack) for function calls
[m] parsing, typecheking, etc. of `null` (also for strings)

[m] Syntax highlighting
[m] double check tokens
  [ ] underscores
  [ ] number separators
  [ ] quotes, special characters, "\n"

[m] yield return
[m] ForEach

[m] LINQ
[m] C# 7 pattern matching
[m] async/await
[m] Extension methods
[ ] (System.Diagnostics.GC) Garbage collection (and `heap_alloc` fills in the gaps)
[m] Old-style tuples (System.Tuple<T1, T2, ...>)

[m] string interpolation

[m] Exceptions
  [ ] Inheritance of exceptions
  [ ] Nested exception handlers
  [ ] Multiple `catch` statements
  [ ] `finally`

[m] Standard library
  [ ] Collections
  [ ] strings
  [ ] files

[m] `using` statement and `IDisposable`
[m] Exam mode in desktop application

[m] Python syntax
[m] var a = 1 + + 1; does print a proper error
[m] inheritance
  [ ] base in class fields (both in actual and temp)
  [ ] before constructor body call base(args)
  [ ] field_get and field_set lookup recursively in base
    [ ] looking up in the methods is done if all recursive base lookups have failed
  [ ] method lookup looks recursively in the inherited C_def.base
  [ ] virtual and abstract methods are lambda fields which are already applied to this in the constructor before body
    [ ] abstract M : this => A => R ~~> field M : Func<A,R>
  [ ] override == field_set of method field
  [ ] abstract methods are initialized to null in the constructor
  [ ] interfaces are abstract classes with only abstract methods
  [ ] private vs protected


[ ] Cleanup/whishlist
  [ ] `while` with fixpoint
  [ ] `resolve_method` with fixpoint
  [ ] Whole semantics must be fully categorical: no apply, almost everything becomes Fun<a,b>
  [ ] Memory values as sums (of basic types)
  [ ] breakpoint right after return (`ret_break?`)
  [ ] Intellisense editor
  [ ] Integration in VSCode
  [g] destructuring assignment of records and tuples

  [g] Invoke statically typed semantics
  [g] renderers defined in standard library, with (+) operator
  [g] String::Length in standard library
