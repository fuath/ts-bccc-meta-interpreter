  [ ] new B(new A(10)) does not work
  [ ] constructor with wrong name is accepted: `class A { public B() { ... } }`
  [ ] methods/functions without body
  [ ] initial values of the proper type for variables at declaration when no value is specified
  [ ] errors
    [ ] are lambda arguments properly checked at both run-time and compile-time?
    [ ] type-checker error = { priority:number, message:string, range:SourceRange }
  [ ] Split into multiple files
    [ ] Bindings.ts becomes a whole directory of files
    [ ] Grammar.ts becomes a whole directory of files
  [ ] Syntax highlighting

[ ] Highlighting
  [ ] Use both start and end
  [ ] Add highlighting to current stack frame/a stack of highlighting values, not a single global value

[ ] Performance optimisations
  [ ] Use mutable state, then clone it to the immutable memory upon `dbg`
  [ ] Data-oriented memory: ints, floats, strings, ..., each an array for faster lookup
  [ ] Invoke statically typed semantics
[ ] Cleanup/whishlist
  [ ] Move ccc_aux to CCC repo
  [ ] parser: operator handling is very repetitive
  [ ] `while` with fixpoint
  [ ] `resolve_method` with fixpoint
  [ ] Whole semantics must be fully categorical: no apply, almost everything becomes Fun<a,b>
  [ ] Garbage collection (and `heap_alloc` fills in the gaps)
  [ ] Memory values as sums (of basic types)
  [ ] breakpoint right after return (`ret_break?`)
