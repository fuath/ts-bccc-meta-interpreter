  [ ] Expressions
    [ ] variable lookup

  [ ] distributive laws applied to monadic combinators such as parallel/concurrent

[ ] Performance optimisations
  [ ] Use mutable state, then clone it to the immutable memory upon `dbg`
  [ ] Data-oriented memory: ints, floats, strings, ..., each an array for faster lookup
  [ ] Invoke statically typed semantics
[ ] Cleanup/whishlist
  [ ] `while` with fixpoint
  [ ] `resolve_method` with fixpoint
  [ ] Whole semantics must be fully categorical: no apply, almost everything becomes Fun<a,b>
  [ ] Garbage collection (and `heap_alloc` fills in the gaps)
  [ ] Memory values as sums (of basic types)
