[g] Generics
  [ ] instantiate on:
    [ ] `decl_forced`
    [ ] `decl`
    [ ] `decl_and_init`
    [ ] constructor type (`new C<int>(...)` instantiates C<int>)
    [ ] generic method call
  [x] Parser
    [ ] Generic method call
  [ ] Generic method
    [ ] Parser
    [ ] Instantiation
  [ ] Covariance and contravariance of Func

[g] HTML renderers for server simulator

[g] Filesystem simulator
  [ ] rendering

[g] unit tests
  [ ] failed coercions and wrong types
    [ ] primitives and operations
    [ ] field getter and setter
    [ ] in both functions and methods
      [ ] return types
      [ ] arguments
      [ ] anonymous functions
      [ ] arrays
      [ ] anonymous functions given to wrong contexts
  [ ] rendering
  [ ] files
  [ ] inheritance
  [ ] generics
    [ ] basic test
    [ ] tuple, record, func, and array
    [ ] instantiation without declaration (`var x = (new C<int>(...)).m(...)`)
  [ ] html rendering

[g] Restructure project
  [ ] Bindings.ts becomes a whole directory of files
  [ ] `Python` semantics should be properly called `C#` semantics
  [ ] Separate parser from type checker

[g] Move ccc_aux to CCC repo


[m] stop
  [ ] Python
  [ ] C#
[m] parse/typecheck errors from dev3 exam (see cesco@Slack)
[m] save code also on wrong attempt (BA)
[m] add `null`
[m] add multiple highlightings (along the stack) for function calls
[m] multithreading: thread_debugger;

[m] ++ operator
  [ ] i++
  [ ] ++i
[m] Getters vs function application (test example below):
  (string,string,(string,Func<int,Func<int,int>>)) v = ("Hello", "world", ("!",(x => y => x * y)));
  var h = v.Item3.Item2(3);
  var y = h(2);
[m] operator overloading in regular classes (classes have a list of methods per name, not just one entry)
  [ ] binary operator overloading
  [ ] unary operator overloading
  [ ] add unary - to standard library

[ ] Next level
  [ ] data science/better dashboard with predictions and risk detection
  [ ] e-commerce spec
  [ ] e-commerce business model (teacher, student, paid materials, free materials, "Tinder-style" limited access, etc.)
  [ ] Integration in VSCode
  [ ] Exceptions
  [ ] Fancy features: LINQ, generators, properties, generic constraints, covariance and contravariance
  [ ] Generic tuple in standard library
  [ ] Proper lex/yacc
  [ ] Covariance and contravariance

[m] inheritance
  [ ] abstract classes are not instantiatable (only internally), same goes for the abstract methods not initialized
[m] double check tokens
  [ ] quotes, special characters, "\n"
[m] (System.Diagnostics.GC) Garbage collection (and `heap_alloc` fills in the gaps)
[m] Exam mode in desktop application
  [ ] login
[m] var a = 1 + + 1; does not print a proper error
[g] Access modifiers: incompatibility errors do not bubble up correctly
[g] closure of functions: free_variables vs decl/decl_and_init (`bound` should become the state)
