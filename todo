[ ] Issues/quality assurance
  [m] initial values of the proper type for variables at declaration when no value is specified
  [m] a variable can be declared twice: this should not be allowed!
  [m] new B(new A(10)) does not work
  [m] constructor with wrong name is accepted: `class A { public B() { ... } }`
  [m] methods/functions without body
  [m] comments
  [g] tokenizer error = { priority:number, message:string, range:SourceRange } (also in debugger stream)
  [g] run-time error = { priority:number, message:string, range:SourceRange } (also in debugger stream)
  [g] Split into multiple files
    [ ] Bindings.ts becomes a whole directory of files
    [ ] Grammar.ts becomes a whole directory of files
  [m] Syntax highlighting
  [m] double check tokens: disallowed variable names, underscores, number separators

[m] Highlighting
  [ ] Use both start and end
  [ ] Add highlighting to current stack frame/a stack of highlighting values, not a single global value?

[ ] Performance optimisations
  [g] Use mutable state, then clone it to the immutable memory upon `dbg`
  [g] Data-oriented memory: ints, floats, strings, ..., each an array for faster lookup
  [g] Invoke statically typed semantics
[ ] Cleanup/whishlist
  [ ] Move ccc_aux to CCC repo
  [ ] `while` with fixpoint
  [ ] `resolve_method` with fixpoint
  [ ] Whole semantics must be fully categorical: no apply, almost everything becomes Fun<a,b>
  [ ] Memory values as sums (of basic types)
  [ ] breakpoint right after return (`ret_break?`)
