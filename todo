[g] Generics
  [ ] instantiate on:
    [ ] generic method call
  [ ] Generic method
    [ ] Parser
    [ ] Type definition
    [ ] Storage into ObjType
    [ ] Instantiation: check existing method instances, if not present: def_method, then store
    [ ] Call: instantiate, then call
[g] multithreading: thread_debugger;
[g] add multiple highlightings (along the stack) for function calls

[g] Filesystem simulator
  [ ] rendering

[g] unit tests
  [ ] failed coercions and wrong types
    [ ] primitives and operations
    [ ] field getter and setter
    [ ] in both functions and methods
      [ ] return types

  [ ] generics
    [ ] array

[g] Restructure project
  [ ] Bindings.ts becomes a whole directory of files
  [ ] `Python` semantics should be properly called `C#` semantics
  [ ] Separate parser from type checker

[g] Move ccc_aux to CCC repo

[m] Generics
  [x] print editor
  [ ] remove (generic type decl) print
  [ ] implicit creation of types not working
  [x] instantiate on:
    [x] generics on simple methods
    [ ] abstract method parameter
    [ ] abstract method return type
    [ ] interface method parameter
    [ ] interface method return type
  [ ] Interfaces with method with generic parameters and return types
  [ ] Abstract classes with method with generic parameters and return types
[m] Generic constraints
  [ ] Parser
  [ ] Validation
[m] \n in debugger GO
[m] Generic interfaces
  [ ] Generic constraints over generic interfaces
[m] parse/typecheck errors from dev3 exam (see cesco@Slack)
[m] `Func<int, C<int>> mk_c = i => new C<int>(i);` does not compile
[m] Arrays of generics do not parse correctly
[m] Add tests
  [ ] generics and inheritance
  [ ] generics and interfaces
[m] save code also on wrong attempt (BA)
[m] add `null`

[m] ++ operator
  [ ] i++
  [ ] ++i
[m] Getters vs function application (test example below):
  (string,string,(string,Func<int,Func<int,int>>)) v = ("Hello", "world", ("!",(x => y => x * y)));
  var h = v.Item3.Item2(3);
  var y = h(2);
[m] operator overloading in regular classes (classes have a list of methods per name, not just one entry)
  [ ] binary operator overloading
  [ ] unary operator overloading
  [ ] add unary - to standard library
[m] decl local
[ ] Next level
  [ ] data science/better dashboard with predictions and risk detection

  [ ] e-commerce business model (teacher, student, paid materials, free materials, "Tinder-style" limited access, etc.)
  [ ] Integration in VSCode/Electron app
  [ ] Exceptions
  [ ] Fancy features: LINQ, generators, properties, covariance and contravariance, generic functions
  [ ] Proper lex/yacc
  [ ] Generic tuple in standard library
  [ ] HTML renderers for server simulator


[m] inheritance
  [ ] abstract classes are not instantiatable (only internally), same goes for the abstract methods not initialized
[m] double check tokens
  [ ] quotes, special characters, "\n"
[m] (System.Diagnostics.GC) Garbage collection (and `heap_alloc` fills in the gaps)
[m] Exam mode in desktop application
  [ ] login
[m] var a = 1 + + 1; does not print a proper error
[g] Access modifiers: incompatibility errors do not bubble up correctly
[g] closure of functions: free_variables vs decl/decl_and_init (`bound` should become the state)
[m] Casting operator for primitives `(int)5.5`
