    [ ] Proper (recursive) field lookups
    [ ] Proper (recursive) expressions
  [ ] localized errors everywhere (curried parameter, used for runtime/compiler errors!)
    [ ] Are lambda arguments properly checked at both run-time and compile-time
    [ ] How are nested errors managed (for example, the errors inside the body of a while or inside the body of a function)?

[ ] Electron playground
  [ ] Basic highlighting of current step
  [ ] Let intern integrate webpack

[ ] Required for basic quality but not basic functionality
  [ ] breakpoint right after return (`ret_break?`)

[ ] Performance optimisations
  [ ] Use mutable state, then clone it to the immutable memory upon `dbg`
  [ ] Data-oriented memory: ints, floats, strings, ..., each an array for faster lookup
  [ ] Invoke statically typed semantics
[ ] Cleanup/whishlist
  [ ] Move ccc_aux to CCC repo
  [ ] parser: operator handling is very repetitive
  [ ] `while` with fixpoint
  [ ] `resolve_method` with fixpoint
  [ ] Whole semantics must be fully categorical: no apply, almost everything becomes Fun<a,b>
  [ ] Garbage collection (and `heap_alloc` fills in the gaps)
  [ ] Memory values as sums (of basic types)
